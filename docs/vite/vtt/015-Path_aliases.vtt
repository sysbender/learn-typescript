00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.920
pass aliases so let's see how it can be

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.960
useful for us I'm going to clear out our

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.360
main Javascript file main.js then let's

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.280
just go ahead and import this CSS file

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
into our main GS file and of course to

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.520
import that I'm going to have to write

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.360
down the whole pass which leads to this

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.239
CSS file like this and then let's add

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.360
one more import and we're going to

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:30.280
import this image so here I'm going to

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.000
have to write the whole pass to this

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.000
image which is contained inside IMG

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.440
folder and then inside index HTML I'm

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.040
going to add another IMG Tech to display

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600
that

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.080
image but for demonstration purposes

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.120
we're going to use JavaScript for it so

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.040
let's select an element by an ID of

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.280
image and assign the URL of an image to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.440
the source attribute like this

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.800
so before switching over to the browser

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.120
we also have to change the extension of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.719
our main Javascript file from DS on JS

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.679
and now let's see how it looks in a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.800
browser so first of all the imported CSS

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.800
file was inserted onto the page in this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.280
style tech and as we can see our

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.440
JavaScript image is also displayed on

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.639
the right side but there is a chance

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.639
that over time our project will become

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:26.159
pretty large with lots of different

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:28.880
Imports and those Imports sometimes can

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.560
be pretty long and just to avoid always

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.400
mentioning the whole pass whenever we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.520
need to import some module that allows

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.600
us to Define so-called pass Al's by

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.520
using which we can drastically shorten

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.159
our import pass so let's just apply pass

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.800
LSS for this two UTS as Al I'm going to

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.719
use add sign and soon we're going to map

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.920
this character to point2 source as its

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.920
folder and to Define our own P LS we

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.480
have to open up VI configuration file

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.159
and in here let's add another

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.920
configuration key called resolve which

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.080
will be an object with one more property

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.719
called LS and in turn this will also be

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.480
an object here we need to define the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:16.760
mapping between our pass ls's and actual

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.159
P that these Alis will be pointing to so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.320
in here I'm going to Define one Alis

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:25.159
that I have used previously it's this at

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.840
sign and as for the pass which this LS

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.679
should be pointing to I'm going to use

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.040
node GS helper called resolve to resolve

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:37.239
the pass to the folder Source assets as

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.320
the first argument to this method I'm

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.159
going to pass the current directory name

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.280
where this configuration file is located

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.719
and we can get it by using de name magic

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.480
variable and as a second argument we

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:55.320
should specify our folder where our P LS

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.679
will be pointing to and at the top let's

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.639
just quickly test this out I'm going to

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:03.960
import this pass module and write

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:06.199
console log statement and then see what

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.719
is actually be printed after calling

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:11.320
that resolve method with those

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.239
parameters so in order to see this lock

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.679
I'm going to have to restart our Dev

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.840
server by running npm run Dev and right

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:22.000
here we can see that pass that was

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.239
printed by that method resolve and it's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.400
exactly the P that we need so our P LS

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.800
will point to as a folder which is

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.520
located inside of source folder and now

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.560
in the browser I'm not supposed to see

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.920
any changes so as we can see the Styles

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.440
have been properly applied and the image

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.440
is also displayed so that means that our

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.760
custom alas was properly configured and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.800
while importing those modules vid has

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.960
replaced that alas with the proper pass

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.440
that that alas points to and in our case

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.719
it is the assis folder inside of source

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.719
folder so at the end let's go back to

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.159
our configur curation file and get rid

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:03.440
of this console log statement and this

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.199
is how we can leverage p ls's in order

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.679
to avoid long passes while importing

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:11.159
modules in this lesson let's talk about
