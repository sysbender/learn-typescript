 
# 📘 Static Assets and the Public Folder in Vite Projects

Vite provides a special `public` folder for serving static assets directly. This guide explains how it works, how it differs from source-based imports, and how to configure and build your project for production.

---

## 🗂 Step 1: Understanding the `public` Folder

### ✅ What Makes It Special?

- Files in `public/` are **served as-is**.
- They are **not processed** or transformed by Vite.
- You **cannot import** them in JavaScript using `import` statements.

### 📄 Example Structure

```bash
public/
└── v.svg
src/
└── assets/img/javascript.svg
```

---

## 🖼 Step 2: Referencing Public Assets in HTML

You can reference public assets directly in HTML:

```html
<img src="/v.svg" />
```

This image is fetched by the browser as a static file.

---

## 📄 Step 3: Importing Assets from `src`

Assets in `src/` can be imported in JavaScript:

```js
import imageUrl from './assets/img/javascript.svg';

document.getElementById('image').src = imageUrl;
```

Vite transforms this into a valid ECMAScript module and appends a hash to the filename during build.

---

## 🏗 Step 4: Building the Project

Run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 🔍 What Happens

- Assets from `src/` are transformed and hashed.
- Assets from `public/` are copied directly into the output folder (`dist/`).
- No transformations are applied to public assets.

---

## ⚙️ Step 5: Customizing the Public Folder Name

You can rename the public folder using `vite.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  publicDir: 'build'
};
```

Then rename the folder:

```bash
mv public build
```

Run the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite will copy files from `build/` into `dist/`.

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Previewing the Production Build

Use Vite’s preview command to serve the built project:

```bash
npm run preview
```

- Serves files from `dist/`
- Runs on port `4173` by default
- Simulates production environment

### 🔍 Observations

- No ECMAScript import statements in the browser
- All modules are bundled into a single JavaScript file

---

## 🔁 Step 7: Switching Back to Development

Stop the preview server and restart development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If needed, clean up the build folder:

```bash
rm -rf dist/
```

## ✅ Summary

| Feature                | `src/` Assets            | `public/` Assets         |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Importable in JS       | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No                    |
| Transformed by Vite    | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No                    |
| Hashed on Build        | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No                    |
| Referenced in HTML     | ✅ Via JS                | ✅ Directly              |
| Copied to `dist/`      | ✅ With transformations  | ✅ As-is                 |

## 📚 Bonus

Use `npm run preview` to test production builds locally. Use `vite.config.js` to customize static asset behavior.
