00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.000
end of the course and in this final

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.520
lesson we're going to take a look how to

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
deploy V application and the service for

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600
the deployment that we are going to be

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.399
using is called GitHub pages in fact

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.279
there are a lot more services that

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:19.560
provide support for when it comes to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.359
deployment and the deployment process is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.479
pretty simple for any of those services

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.720
so we're going to review deployment

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:30.239
steps by using GitHub Pages as always I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.239
have already prepared default vid

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.920
application which we're going to deploy

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.760
and actually before get into the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.479
deployment we need to make sure that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.800
that our repository exists on GitHub

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:44.319
which in my case it does so we can go

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.319
directly to the deployment we will not

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:49.800
change any default configurations so

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:53.600
after building our project all build

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.479
files will be located inside this folder

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.399
and this is exactly the folder which is

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:01.279
going to be deployed so here in docs

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.439
let's choose the option deployment to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:08.120
GitHub pages and our repository URL

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.279
corresponds to this format where we have

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.960
two URL segments first one is our GitHub

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:16.159
username and the second one is the name

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.840
of the repository so the only

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.760
configuration option we have to specify

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.159
will be the option called base and this

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.319
option should contain the name of our

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.399
repository so let's just go ahead and

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.319
create configuration file vi. config.js

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.720
in the root of this project from here

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.760
we're going to expert configuration

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.359
object which with only one option base

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.199
where we're going to specify repository

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.479
name which in my case is vit Das

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:49.800
deployment and once again this is really

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.439
important that this option Val should

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.920
match repository name on GitHub so now

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.080
we have to create new commit where we're

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.439
going to include our configuration file

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.239
let's specify any message and push this

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.359
commit to

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:10.680
GitHub after that let's just make sure

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:14.159
that the new commit appears in the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.680
GitHub history of our project it is the

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.199
second commit then let's open up

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.520
settings tab the main branch of our

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:25.319
repository is main so we're going to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.680
deploy this branch and now on the left

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.479
side let's open up page called pages and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.720
in here we have to set up some

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:37.040
deployment configurations firstly in

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.680
this Source dropdown we have to choose

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.720
option GitHub actions and then let's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.800
click this link create your own which is

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.479
basically going to create an empty

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.239
deployment configuration file let's

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:54.359
clear out all this predefined content

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.600
and specify our own configurations and

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.880
these configurations are listed in vit

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.319
docs so we just have to copy over this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.920
whole configuration paste it in that

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.239
file and let's quickly go through some

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.680
of the options specified in this file in

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.399
here we can see which branch is going to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.840
be deployed and down here there are a

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:20.239
couple of steps which will be executed

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.000
during deployment for example in here we

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.680
can see that the node version which is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.760
going to be used to build our project

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.920
will be version 18 then we're going to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.520
install all npm dependencies by running

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.279
npm install after that we're going to

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.720
build a project by running npm run build

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:43.840
and at the end once this folder with our

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.120
built files will be created this folder

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.000
will be deployed to GitHub Pages server

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.399
then let's just give this configuration

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.479
file a name for example deploy yml and

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:58.880
click commit changes in here let's make

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.399
sure that the new commit will be created

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.000
on the main branch let's click commit

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:06.960
changes once again and then we can see

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.720
another new commit in the commit history

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.960
this the commit with the configuration

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.520
file for deployment we have just created

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.319
and then if we open up top actions here

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.840
we can actually see the new deployment

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:22.319
task that is currently running and this

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.199
is our deployment task so anytime we're

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:27.199
going to push changes to the main branch

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.840
it will automatically kick off the

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.120
deployment process and by clicking on

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.080
this task we can actually inspect what

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.080
steps are executed during the deployment

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.800
and once this deployment will be

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.760
successfully finished we can once again

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.399
open up settings tab and then go to

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.479
Pages page and in here we will see the

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:50.800
URL where our application will be

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.479
available on the web so by following

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.040
this URL we can see that our application

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.720
was successfully deployed on GitHub

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.000
pages and that's it we were able to

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.560
successfully deploy V application on

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.159
GitHub Pages server as we can see it was

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.279
pretty simple process and if we decide

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.000
to deploy our project by using another

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.680
hosting provider the deployment process

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.680
is going to be pretty simple as well and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.720
with that we are finishing this course

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.720
