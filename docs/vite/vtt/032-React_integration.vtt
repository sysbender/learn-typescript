00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.239
take a look at how we can integrate

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.920
react into vid project so I have

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:11.600
prepared an empty vid project which

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.319
doesn't use any Frameworks so let's get

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.520
to integrating react and actually before

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.560
we start there is an option which VD

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.439
provides us with which allows us to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.960
scaffold with project with react

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.160
integrated right from the beginning and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.520
for that we just need to use value react

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.239
for this template option and run the

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.840
following comment but just to better

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.800
understand this whole process and how

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.600
the integration happens we're going to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.720
do all these steps manually and before

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.520
we start we actually have to install all

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.560
necessary npm packages such as libraries

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.520
react react Dom and VD plugin which

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.680
allows us to import react components and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.080
after all those libraries are installed

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.040
we have to open up configuration file

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.000
V.C config.js and in here let's import

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.479
the plugin from the vdjs plug-in react

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.399
package and then to include this plugin

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.439
we have to call this function react in

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.479
this array of plugins like so and that's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.319
basically it now we can just start

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.160
developing react application so Aron

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:24.680
starts with the main script file

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.880
main.js let's remove Aron from this file

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.160
and also rename this file on main. jsx

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.239
since we're going to use jsx syntax in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.960
this file and also we have to fix the P

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:40.120
to this file inside of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.760
index.html so let's go here and fix this

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.520
extension right here as we can see we

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.640
already have a de with an identifier app

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.000
this will be a de where we're going to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.279
mount react application so let's create

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.760
our root component we'll call the new

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:58.479
file

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.199
app.jsx and here we're going to use a

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.479
simple example which will be basic

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:07.080
counter component so let's import use

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.880
State function from react then we're

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.279
also going to create file with Styles

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.800
and import them right here and then down

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:17.760
here let's define our component function

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.239
up so this function is going to have

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.960
only one state variable which will be a

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.359
counter initial value for this counter

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.399
will be zero and right here let's define

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:32.880
our template for this component so I'm

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:35.399
going to add H1 element with the counter

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.760
text and down Bellow we're going to

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:41.279
create the button which is going to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.160
increment our counter and just to see if

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:47.640
our counter gets incremented we're also

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.080
going to show this variables value is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.399
the label for this button like so and

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.319
now we'll register The Listener which

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:58.080
will be fired when clicking on this

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.239
button and inside of this listener we're

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.080
basically going to update State variable

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.760
count by incrementing it by one and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.720
finally at the bottom of this file let's

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.520
export this component as a default

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.080
expert and also just to check if we will

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.560
be able to import CSS files with Styles

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.640
and those Styles will be applied to our

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.520
components let's create basic CSS file

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.399
with the name up. CSS and in here I'm

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.720
going to describe one rule for the H1

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:34.439
element and make the color of this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.279
element blue because previously I have

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.560
already imported this CSS file in our

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:42.680
component which is supposed to make this

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.199
H1 Element blue so now that we have our

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.920
root component in place we actually have

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:50.239
to initialize react application inside

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.439
of our main script so in here we're

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.920
going to import react Dom Library from

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.960
the react Dom client and also we're

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.439
going to import our root component up

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.159
from

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.000
app.jsx in here we have to pass Dom

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.239
element where we're going to mount our

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.680
application into in this case we're

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.239
going to mount it inside of element with

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.520
an idea of up and eventually to render

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.439
this application we're calling method

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.960
render and as the parameter we're

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:26.439
specifying our root component as the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.920
jsx and after that if we're going to

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:31.600
take a look in a browser sure enough

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.279
we're going to see work en counter and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.080
that means that react application was

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:39.359
properly initialized so now just to see

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.120
what Transformations are being applied

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:44.199
to our react components we can use

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.680
plug-in inspect which I have already

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.080
pre-installed which allows us to open up

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.319
this URL in a browser and see

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.080
Transformations that happen to our

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:57.920
inputs so in this case case once browser

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.720
reads main. jsx file then it sees this

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.399
import of app.jsx component then it

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.960
fires the call to the server to fetch

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.920
the code of this component and instead

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.040
of giving us Z row content of this

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.960
component VD applies react plugin to

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.640
convert the content of this component

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.080
into render function which will be

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.800
recognized in the browser and then this

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.880
function runs in a browser in this way

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.439
we're seeing our counter component on

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.399
the page and if we open up our inspector

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.800
and take a look at the transformation

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:34.840
which is happening with our component

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.120
file we're going to see that this jsx

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.359
syntax was converted into proper render

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.120
function which will be recognized and

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:45.720
run in the browser and this is it the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.560
whole process of react integration into

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.399
vid project was pretty simple so just to

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.720
recap we had to install three

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:58.560
dependencies react react Dom and plugin

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.399
for react and then we had to include

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.479
this plugin inside vid configuration

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:06.680
file in this plugins array and this is

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:10.359
what actually allows us to create an

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.319
import react components in our files so

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:14.920
we can start developing our react

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:18.199
applications in vid projects as we are

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.319
used to we are slowly approaching the
