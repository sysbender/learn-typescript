WEBVTT

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.880
import CSS files in JavaScript modules

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.480
and also in the previous lesson we have

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.919
taken a look how it works with CSS

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.120
modules specification and in this lesson

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.080
we're going to see how it allows us to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.480
apply post CSS transformations to CSS

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.880
Imports and just to demonstrate how to

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.799
work with post CSS plugins in vid

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.360
projects we're going to install very

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:29.440
popular post CSS plugin which is

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.000
Tailwind CSS framework so in docs let's

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.400
open up installation instructions in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.880
this case we're installing Tailwind CSS

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.919
in vid project so let's use page how to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.399
install tailin CSS Within withd project

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:45.880
and here we can skip the first step

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.880
because First Step initializes default

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.559
withd project but we already have a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.880
project so let's go directly to step

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.360
number two and install all necessary

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.679
packages to provide support for Tailwind

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.840
CSS the first comment is going to

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.600
install the following packages Tailwind

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.919
CSS post CSS and auto prefixer and the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.760
second command is going to generate two

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:13.840
configuration files one for Tailwind CSS

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.720
called twin. config.js and another file

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.399
is post CSS configuration and by the way

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.240
generated post CSS configuration file

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.080
already contains necessary plugins which

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.640
provide support for tawin CSS there is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.360
Tailwind CSS plugin itself and auto

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.080
prefixer to provide support for modern

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.600
CSS rules in most browsers and now we

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.520
need to tell Tailwind CSS utility which

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.120
files will include Tailwind CSS classes

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.919
and we can do it by specifying value for

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.200
Content property here we just list pass

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:49.279
to all the files with tawin CSS classes

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.559
and since in our case we're only going

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:55.039
to use Tailwind classes within

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:57.520
index.html let's just mention pass to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.640
this file and on the next step we're

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.520
going to have to add the following

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.000
Tailwind CSS directive to our main CSS

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.399
file so let's copy over these three

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.520
directives so inside of our project

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.360
let's create new CS s file 5. CSS inside

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.360
of assets folder and place those three

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.640
dires in here and finally after we

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.279
restart server by running npm Rand Dev

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.039
we can start using all available

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:29.399
Tailwind CSS classes in our source files

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:32.120
like this so first of all let's restart

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.640
our server by pressing contrl C in here

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.559
to stop the server and run it again by

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.720
running npm randev let's clear out

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:44.840
everything within main.js file and leave

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.440
only import which includes tellin CSS so

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.760
we only import 5. CSS file because this

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.120
is the file where we previously included

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.440
TN CSS directives and now when browser

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.840
Encounters this CSS import it is going

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.080
to make request to our VD server and VD

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.039
server is going to respond with valid

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.919
EAS module which means it has converted

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:11.120
our CSS file with included Tailwind CSS

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:14.080
on the Fly and hold CSS style sheet has

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.279
been assigned to with CSS constant and

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.919
then this constant has been used to

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:22.480
inject this Styles onto our page as we

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:25.279
can see this style includes generated

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.520
tailn CSS style sheet so let's go ahead

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:30.360
and try to apply a couple of Tailwind

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.840
CSS classes to our heading let's copy

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.360
over code of this background color from

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.840
this file and style our H1 heading and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.360
in deln CSS the class which corresponds

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.240
to background color starts with BG and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.919
then here in square brackets we can

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.600
specify Dynamic value of the color so

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.760
let's paste that hexadecimal code and

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.919
let's also make text color white and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.440
let's better apply those classes to the

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.320
body element and here we go in Def toes

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.480
we can see that the appropriate Tailwind

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.159
CSS classes have been generated and sure

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.320
enough proper Styles have been applied

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.279
and in terms of Transformations let's

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.640
see what transformation have been

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:16.559
applied to our initial CSS file as we

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.960
know our initial stylesheet contains

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:22.559
only Tailwind CSS directives so tawin

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.679
CSS plugin that we have included in post

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:29.159
CSS configuration has turned this three

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:31.200
directive into full tawin CSS stylesheet

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.799
and then vid has taken this generated

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200
stylesheet and applied another

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:38.960
transformation which eventually turned

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.760
this stylesheet into valid ecmascript

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.799
module so at the end this code was run

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.440
in the browser and tawin CSS Styles have

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:50.200
been included on the page let's just try

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.039
to use another Tailwind CSS class to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.000
make font size 30 pixels and in a

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.320
browser in order to see newly generated

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.080
class we don't even need to refresh the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.799
page all modifications are reflected on

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.320
the page instantly thanks to v hot

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:08.000
module replacement feature and this is

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.320
how we can work with po CSS

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.039
transformations in VD Pro projects we

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.279
just need to create post CSS file in our

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.399
project install all necessary post CSS

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:22.120
plugins then include those plugins in

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:23.880
post CSS configuration file and it is

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.760
going to automatically apply all

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.840
necessary post CSS transformations to

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.600
all imported CSS

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.640
files let's see how easy it is to use
