WEBVTT

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.239
take a look at how we can integrate

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.920
framework view in vid project so I have

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:12.120
already scaffold the default vid project

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.720
so let's start development server by

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.199
running npm randev and by the way whil

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.359
scolding new VD project there is a

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.199
special command that we can use which

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.880
will basically scaffold VI project with

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.800
view framework already integrated but

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.520
just to better understand this whole

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.199
process and to see what is going on

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.439
under the hood we're going to do this

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.800
manually and the first thing we need to

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:41.080
do is of course install all necessary

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.560
npm dependencies such as framework view

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.520
itself and vid plugin which will allow

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.640
us to convert files with an extension.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.560
view into Jo script code so after

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.479
installing both of these dependencies we

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.199
need to open up VD configuration file v.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.720
config.js and in here we have to include

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.800
that plugin we have just installed plug

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.199
plugin view into this array by calling

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.479
this function

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:13.479
View and then let's just remove

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.880
everything from the main.js file and

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.520
start writing view component so inside

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.279
of our index.html file we already have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.560
an element with an IDE of up this will

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:27.319
be an element where we're going to Mound

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.960
our View application so firstly we're

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:32.720
going to create the root component up.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.680
View and for demonstration purposes we

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.600
we're going to use a very basic example

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.040
of a counter component so I'm going to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.800
create here one reactive variable by

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.640
running function ref this variable is

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.080
going to store current value of our

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.560
counter and inside the template of this

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.319
component let's add H1 element with a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.439
text counter and right under we're going

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.080
to add a button which will allow us to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.359
increment count variable so let's also

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.560
output develop the count variable in

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:10.279
here and register click listener on this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.560
button which will basically increment

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.920
count variable like this so now that we

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.279
have one view component we need to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.560
initialize View application in our main

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:24.359
script so in here firstly let's import

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.080
our root component from the file up.

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:30.720
view and also we'll need to import

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.680
function create up from The View package

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.160
which is going to be used to initialize

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.040
our review application and in here let's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.239
call this function create up pass in our

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.920
root component and then call in function

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.479
Mount and specifying an identifier of

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.279
that element where we're going to mount

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:52.640
our application into and just as a

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:55.279
reminder we already have an element with

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.000
an IDE of up in our

00:02:55.279 --> 00:03:01.279
index.html so now in the browser as we

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.840
can see we have a working counter so our

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.920
View application was properly

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.479
initialized and now let's take a look at

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.600
the transformation which wi has applied

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:13.479
to our app component I have additionally

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.560
installed plugin called VD plugin

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:19.120
inspect in order to see what

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.920
transformation VD applies to our modules

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.439
so we can open up this URL in the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.040
browser and in here we're going to see

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:29.439
all those Transformations done to our

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.920
modules so whenever we are importing up.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.760
view component the plugin is going to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.800
take the content of this component and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.080
turn all this content into valid

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.800
JavaScript code in other words into the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.800
render function which will be called on

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.479
the client side and render our component

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.479
on the page and now let's also take a

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.720
look on the network tab so when browser

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.720
fetches

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.239
main.js then it fires the call to the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.479
server to fetch the content of the

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.239
update view component but instead of

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:06.040
giving us the r cont content of the

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.479
update view component vit has applied

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.080
the plugin to the file with this. view

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:14.080
extension which would transform view

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.439
template into valid JavaScript syntax

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.760
and this is the code which is

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.439
responsible for rendering counter

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.399
component on the page so as you can see

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:25.479
it was very easy to integrate view

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:28.040
framework into vid project initially we

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.439
just had to install to npm dependencies

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.000
view framework itself and vid plugin to

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:37.120
transform View files into JavaScript

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.600
code and then we had to include this

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.319
plugin inside of V configuration file

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.239
just like any other we plugin and after

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.720
doing all these steps we have actually

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:50.960
provided the full support of the view

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.680
framework inside vid project so we can

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.720
develop View application in a normal way

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.560
by creating components with view

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
extensions importing those components

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.920
they will be properly transformed into

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.680
valid JavaScript code and and everything

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.279
will be working fine and this is how we

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.600
integrate view framework in vid

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.479
projects in this lesson we're going to
