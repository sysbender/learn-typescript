00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.600
integrate typescript with the invit

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.920
project in this lesson we're going to

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.800
see how to integrate es link which is a

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.400
static analyzis tool for JavaScript so

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.920
let's get started and in our main. ES

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.560
file we're going to add one es link

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.120
violation let's add a semicolon after

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.199
this function declaration and since

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.639
we're going to have to make es link

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.679
analyze typescript files there is a

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:32.840
special plug-in for it that we can use

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.239
called typescript es link this tool

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.520
basically enables es L support for

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.360
typescript and as always the first thing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.360
we have to do before using this plugin

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.480
is to install all necessary dependencies

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.239
so let's copy over this commment and run

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.719
it in our terminal on the next step we

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.239
will actually have to create

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.320
configuration file for eslint with the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.840
name eslint RC do CJs and paste there

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.120
the following content so in my editor

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.800
I'm going to create new file with this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.320
name paste here all the content I have

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.080
just copied and then again let's go back

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.280
to the browser and as a third step we

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.600
are ready to run our es l so to execute

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.520
es L we need to run npx ESL and as an

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.960
argument into this comment we specify

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.120
the folder where es link should be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
executed in our case it's fine to

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.560
specify a root folder of our project so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm going to use dot let's execute this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
command in a terminal and as we can see

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.560
as a result there are a lot more errors

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
as we have initially expected and among

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.159
all these errors we also can see that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960
error we have made intentionally by

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.199
adding semicolon to the end of the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.159
function declaration and by the way the

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:45.400
rest of errors are coming from analyz

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.719
and JavaScript files so so we need to

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.080
ignore all the JavaScript files and run

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.560
yesl only within typescript files and to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.320
tell yes L which files it should ignore

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.239
we can create special file for eslint

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.679
called eslint ignore and here we can

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.520
list those files that should be ignored

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.480
so to ignore all JavaScript files we can

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.960
use the following notation asterisk do

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.120
JS so after that if we're going to

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.280
execute npx es lint again we're going to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.639
see only one error which is that error

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.400
that is coming from our typescript file

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.840
where we have intentionally added

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.719
semicolon to the end of function

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.880
declaration so as we can see to run ESL

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.960
checks in withd projects we need to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.520
start a separate ESL process alongside

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.280
our main VD build process and this is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.000
also recommended by VD to prevent

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.520
deferring main build process but if you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.199
don't want to do this and prefer that VD

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.880
will run es link during the build

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:48.800
process we can achieve it by installing

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.639
the following plugin with plugin Checker

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.880
we have already used this plugin in the

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.440
previous lesson when we were integrating

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.800
typescript within vid project but

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.400
besides of integrating typescript this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.320
plugin is also capable of integrating

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.600
other tools and one of such tools is as

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.719
link and this time we're not going to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.400
install this plugin again since we have

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.920
already installed it in the previous

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.000
lesson so in here let's open up

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.120
documentation to run eslint and the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.239
first thing to do before running eslint

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.920
is actually install eslint executable on

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.719
a system and then we're going to make V

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.480
use this executable to run es L checks

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.840
and to achieve it we need to copy the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.440
following lines go to our re

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.239
configuration file with config JS and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.560
paste those lines in here like this here

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.280
we're basically specifying the command

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.760
which will be used to run as L and as we

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.520
can see this command also contains P to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.480
files that es Lane should scan and since

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.159
in our case types script files is

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.080
located within the root of our project

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.920
let's correct this pass by removing

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.960
Source folder and after this if we open

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.400
up our browser again we're going to see

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.840
e lint error in here so our es lint

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.120
integration works perfectly and now

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.520
every time wi is going to build our

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.679
project at the same time is going to run

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.120
eslint analyzer and show all eslint

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:18.199
errors in the following form and by the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.159
way the same output we can see in the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.400
server locks in the terminal top where

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:26.440
we executed npm runev command and now

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.920
just to see if this error is going to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.679
disappear we're going to switch over to

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.600
main.ts and remove this semicolon from

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:36.560
here going back to the browser again and

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.199
this time we don't see any es lint

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.840
errors and of course message saying that

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.280
no errors were found appears in the logs

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.199
right here and this is how easy it is to

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.040
integrate es lint into VD

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.400
projects VD offers handy feature called
