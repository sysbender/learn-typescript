WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.680
this course will be about frontend

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.640
bundler of new generation called vit and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.840
because of that it provides much faster

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.920
developer experience compared to

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.040
traditional front end bundlers such as

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.559
web pack so in this course we're going

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.560
to review most of the V features and

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.800
we'll be doing it step by step to better

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240
understand how V Works which will allow

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.000
us to use this tool more efficiently so

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.439
let's get started and install it locally

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.599
for this I'm going to use package

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.680
manager called npm so let's copy this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.079
command and run it in a terminal this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.879
will prompt us to enter project

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.360
name then we're presented with option to

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.280
choose which framework we'd like to use

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.640
we're not going to use any specific

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.760
framework but instead we'll review with

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.840
features by using vanilla JavaScript

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.840
then it will ask us if we'd like to use

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.359
typescript we will definitely have a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.519
lesson about how to use typescript in VD

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.920
projects but most part of the course

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.719
will be using vanilla Javas script and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.920
at the end we'll see three commments

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.720
that we need to run sequentially in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.000
order to run vid server firstly let's go

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.200
inside of project folder in here let's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.640
run npm install to install all npm

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.119
dependencies and finally we can start

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.200
vid server by running npm runev here we

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.240
will see which address we can use to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.560
access our project in a browser so let's

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.320
open up a new tab and here we see

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.680
welcome screen of the default with

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.240
project then let's open up project

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.680
inside of editor I'm going to use vs

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.119
code and just to make it easier for us

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.920
to learn how it works we're going to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.320
install helpful VD plugin called VD

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.759
plugin inspect which will allow us to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.280
see how VD transforms our source files

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.680
so we will get access to such dashboard

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.399
in the browser and all transformations

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.280
that we will make with our source files

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.159
will be visible to us at every step of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.399
Transformations this plugin can be

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.320
installed by running the following npm

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.200
command in the terminal so let's run it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.879
and wait until installation is finished

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.520
and just to let V know about this plugin

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.160
we need to add the following

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.800
instructions inside of V configuration

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.959
file first we have to create this file

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.599
in the project route unless it is

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.319
already created and paste in here all

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.080
those instructions that we just copied

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.480
and then we're given with address which

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.080
we can open up in the browser where our

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.440
in inst inspector will be available but

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.519
for now it is not accessible yet we need

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.120
to restart our V server let's go back to

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.400
terminal stop development server by

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.920
pressing crl C then run it again with a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.239
commment npm runev and besides with

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.599
servers address we also see another

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.760
address where our inspector will be

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.519
available and we'll see this screen that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840
means our inspector has been

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.040
successfully installed what it is and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.280
how to use it we will be talking about

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.440
in the next slide lessons and for now

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.720
let's see which file gets loaded in the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.159
browser when we access root of our R

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.239
server and the file which is loaded is

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.080
called

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.680
index.html which is in the project route

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.239
here we can see that this page also

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.599
includes main Javascript file which by

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.120
the way is included as native ecmascript

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.560
module because here we can see attribute

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.239
type with Val a module and all our

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.040
application gets mounted into this deal

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.319
with an IDE of app so now let's open up

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.560
main Javascript file and see what is

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.400
happening inside and right away we can

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.000
see unusual UTS of CSS file and its VG

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.720
files which are not supported natively

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.439
in browsers so if we would be using

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.519
normal static server those UTS would

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.799
fail but it treats those UTS in a

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.519
special way and before serving those UTS

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.680
to the browser it applies all necessary

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.120
transformations to make browsers to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.120
recognize such UTS where we're going to

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.040
talk about it in details in upcoming

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.799
lessons but basically whenever we import

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.560
CSS files like this V is going to inject

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.159
all these Styles onto the page and

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.840
whenever we import assets such as SVG

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.359
images V is going to expert pass to this

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.680
file and save it in JavaScript logo

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.759
variable so then this pass can be used

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.800
in a normal way for example inside of

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.639
source attribute as we can see right

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.479
here to reference corresponding image

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.440
and sure now this image will be visible

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.080
on the page it is this JavaScript logo

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.560
the same thing happens when we import v.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.960
SVG file but there is one important

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.120
difference you may notice that vsvg file

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.240
is not in our project route it is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.000
actually inside of a special folder with

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.320
the name public and for it this public

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.520
folder stores all static assets and all

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.840
static assets that are stored in this

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.600
public folder will not be processed by

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.240
VD but instead will be returned to the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.280
the browser in its original form we're

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.840
also going to talk about this folder in

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.120
detail in upcoming lessons and finally

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.800
the last import we can see right here is

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.960
normal import of ecmascript module it is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.039
this counter. JS file which provides

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.720
functionality for the counter whenever

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.080
we click on that button on the page and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.160
we see that the counter increases with a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.720
click but we are going to start our

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.120
explanation of V from the very beginning

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.520
so let's clear everything inside of main

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.280
Js file let's also remove counter. JS

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.880
module which we will no longer use and

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.919
finally we'll remove all default Styles

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.639
inside of style. CSS and now we're done

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.520
with installation and initial setup from

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.840
the next lesson we're going to start

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.919
reviewing V's features step by step when
