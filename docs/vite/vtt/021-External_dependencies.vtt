WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.320
created npm package and use this package

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.000
in the client application let's start

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.920
development server by running npm randev

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.679
to start our application in the browser

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.880
and the result of using our custom

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.199
package is shown in a console it

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.960
basically have extracted usern names

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.079
from the initial array of the user

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.880
object s and all of that has been

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.360
implemented in previous lessons so let's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.760
just recall how that works in the main

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.520
script of our Clan application we are

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.679
importing functionality from our package

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.639
but not only from the main module of our

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.840
package also from the sub module lock

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.800
and currently the project which contains

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.199
our package has two JavaScript files

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.880
index.js and lock. JS and each of these

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.239
files experts one function and these two

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.440
functions we are actually importing in

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.079
our client application from different

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.520
sub modules but as we can see currently

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.440
our package is pretty simple it doesn't

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.719
even use any third party libraries so in

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.239
this lesson we're going to review how to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:11.280
integrate third party library in our

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:13.199
custom package so in this file index.js

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.239
we're going to import third party

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:18.800
Library called collect. JS which

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:21.239
basically has lots of utilities to work

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.520
with array of objects and we're going to

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:25.679
to leverage this function inside of our

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.880
plug function but firstly let's just

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.599
rename this function on plug and lock

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.920
and then we'll basically do the same

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:36.040
which is extract a key from each object

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.599
of the collection but this time we're

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.880
going to use plug method on our

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.239
collection and we'll basically do the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.280
same here but by using method PL which

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:49.960
Library collect JS provides us with like

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.480
so and then besides returning this

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.719
result we're also going to look the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.440
result in this function and right after

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.639
we return this result so besides the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520
main purpose of this function we're also

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.000
loging the result in the console right

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.239
away and then let's see what is going to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.239
happen if we'll try to build this

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.599
Library so in the terminal let's run npm

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.639
run buildt and we are receiving the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.280
following error that the collect JS

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:20.599
Library cannot be imported since this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.239
Library does not exist in our package so

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.040
what we need to to do is to actually

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.360
install this Library by running npm

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.639
install collect. JS and now once I'm

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.920
going to start the build process once

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:37.280
again this time it worked we still see

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.000
four build files but this time we can

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.320
notice that the sizes of some files

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.559
drastically increased for example the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.320
size of the main file index.js is now

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:50.400
almost 60 kiloby and that is because

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.079
when we were importing Library collect

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.040
JS in in our script VD has actually

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.880
taken the whole source code of sord

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.040
party library and put it in the build

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.239
and which is why the resulting file of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.159
our library has much bigger size now but

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.440
before we'll solve this problem let's

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.040
just import our new function plug and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.239
lock in the client application and see

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.840
if it's going to work so now we don't

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.840
need to additionally Call the lock

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.159
function in order to print results in a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.079
console because the new function plug

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.360
and lock is going to extract keys from

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.880
every object of the array as well as

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.199
print the result in a console and in the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.520
console as we can see we are seeing

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.119
expected result with the difference that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.079
our result is contained within items

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:39.639
property of the wrapper object that's

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.159
how the library collect JS works it

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.440
returns us not only the result in Array

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.960
but an object which wraps our collection

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.199
but this is not the most optimal

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.679
solution of building our libraries

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:54.000
because anytime we're going to third

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:56.559
party Library the file size of our

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.280
library will be drastically increased so

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.960
let's see what we can do about it and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.440
what it has to offer in this regard so

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.760
moving on let's open up configuration

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.960
file vi. config.js and in here we're

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.719
going to add another option which is

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.559
called rollup options which will be an

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:18.199
object with the key external and this is

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:20.559
where we have to specify Library names

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.239
which we don't need to be bundled along

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:25.440
with the code of our library and since

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:28.239
by now we're using only one third party

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.239
Library called collect JS I'm going to

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:33.679
include only one name in this array like

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:36.800
so and then let's watch the size of the

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:40.000
bundlet file index.js so currently the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.559
size of index.js file is around 60

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.599
kiloby but after I rerun the build

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:47.639
process by executing npm run build this

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.520
time we see that the file size was

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.480
drastically dropped and if we're going

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.679
to take a look at the content of the

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.679
build file

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:57.760
index.js we're seeing only our cod in

00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:00.480
here and the import of the library

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.880
collect JS but the source code of this

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.599
library is absent and which is why we

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.800
don't even need to install the library

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:10.719
collect JS in our project so let's

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.000
remove this dependency by running npm

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:16.040
uninstall and dependency name and let's

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
just rerun the build process of our

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.040
package once again by executing npm run

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.760
build so now if we go to the browser and

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.800
check the result in our client

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.440
application again we're supposed to get

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.079
an error since our package relies on the

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.000
third party Library collect JS but that

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:35.960
library was not included in the build

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
version of our package but surprisingly

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.800
as we can see we didn't receive any

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.159
errors so it worked and the reason it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.000
worked is that previously when we

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.880
started development server vit has gone

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.440
ahead and cached some dependencies in

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.960
the folder. vit which is inside of node

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.360
modules and this folder has cached

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.040
version of the library collect GS so

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.960
let's just go back to the editor open up

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.239
no modules folder of our client

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.920
application and remove that folder with

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:09.040
sketched dependency is called vit so now

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.559
let's restart development server in the

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.800
client application and we are receiving

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:17.199
an error that dependency client JS

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.880
cannot be imported since it is missing

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.679
from our client application as well as

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.440
from the build file of our library and

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:26.880
the first thing that comes to mind is

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.960
actually install this Library into our

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.880
client application so let's do just that

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.120
I'm going to execute npm install and

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.880
specify Library name collect. JS and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.000
then after running npm run Dev again

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.319
we're receiving a different error

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.639
similar but this time it could not

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.880
resolve UTS of our own package plug

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.679
because the link to our package which we

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.399
have previously added to the node

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:56.359
modules folder of the client application

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:59.080
by executing npm link is gone for some

00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:01.200
reason so let's just add the link to our

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.080
package inside node modules folder One

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.599
More Time by running npm link and our

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.960
package name I am not going to explain

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:11.960
in detail what this common is doing

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.359
since we were talking about it in one of

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.359
the previous lessons so now that we have

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:20.200
added back link plug which points to our

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:22.719
package inside non modules folder we can

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.120
try to start development server once

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:27.880
again and again the previous error is

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.840
back that it cannot resolve dependency

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.240
collect JS so we're going to solve this

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.439
problem in the next lesson when we will

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.479
publish our package to the npm registry

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:40.319
and then instead of using npm link to

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.559
make our package available to the client

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.639
application we're going to install our

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:48.559
package as any other third party

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:50.599
dependency by running npm install it's
