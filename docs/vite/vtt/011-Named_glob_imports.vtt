00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.160
reviewing function called Globe to

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.920
import several modules at once so in the

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.319
previous lesson we have reviewed one

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.000
configuration option with the name eager

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.480
and in this lesson we'll continue

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.760
reviewing some other options for example

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.640
we can also use option called as and in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.440
case we specify whether they rot for

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.960
this option then the object which Globe

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.760
function will return is going to contain

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.400
the following every key of this object

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.319
will still be passed to a particular

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.760
module but the Val is different because

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:38.040
this time it contains content of those

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.720
modules instead of the function which

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.839
allows us to load particular module

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.440
dynamically so when browser were

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.280
requesting those modules to fetch them

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.520
as we can see VD has replied with the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.440
following content it has produced used

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.079
validas script module where default

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.720
expert contains module content in a

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.640
string form so literally what V has done

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.280
it read content of every module

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.359
converted it to a string and returned to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.240
a browser but if I'm going to specify

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:12.280
value URL for the option s in here this

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.680
time glob function is going to produce

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.240
the following result we still get an

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
object where every key is a passed to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.119
individual module and the Val this time

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.200
is absolute pass to those modules so as

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.720
a response to calls which fetch those

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.599
modules in the browser VD has return the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.520
valid masr module where default expert

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:36.640
is pass to that module and now let's try

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.280
to do the following I'm going to add an

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.559
expert of constant name into every

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.440
module in the first module this constant

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:47.559
will be equal to Jane the second module

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.440
B already contains this constant with

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:53.280
value JN so let's at the same constant

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.799
into module C and the value in here

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.480
let's say will be JY and I'm also going

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.119
to place default expert into every

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.359
module the first module will expert

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.920
letter A as a default expert the second

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.760
module will export letter b and the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.119
third module will export letter C and

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.400
then back to our main Javascript file

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:17.079
let's remove this configuration object

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400
that we're passing to Globe function

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.119
remove the comment from this channel of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.280
code and this time let's use one

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:27.480
configuration option called import and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.520
what this option allows us to do it lets

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.400
us specify name the expert which would

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.319
like to import while importing modules

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.359
in bulk by using glob function so for

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.480
example if every module we're trying to

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.680
import in bulk contains some named

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.079
expert instead of importing anything

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.799
else we can literally specify a

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.520
particular input that would like and

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.960
since all our module expert constant

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.480
with a name name we can specify this

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.000
name in here and since we have already

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.240
specified that every import should

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.720
contain import Cod name that promise

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.680
which will be resolved after dynamically

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.359
Import in module will contain this data

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.760
so let's rename this parameter on name

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.240
and use it to print it out and there we

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.039
go after every Dynamic module gets

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.480
fetched and executed we also see the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:24.480
value of the name variable in here which

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.599
contains names and if for example I only

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.960
want to import default expert we can

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.480
literally mention default in here and

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.680
this time instead of names we're going

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.200
to get Val experted by default from

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.079
those modules and let's take a look at

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.240
one more combination of configuration

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.799
options we're going to use eager option

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.400
with value true and import option with

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.480
value name and by now we already know

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.160
that by using these configuration

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.079
options we disable a dynamic nature of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.640
importing modules as well as we specify

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.559
that we'd like to import only imports

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.839
called name and as a result we're going

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:09.400
to receive such object where every key

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:12.480
is a pass to individual imported module

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.079
and as a value for those keys we receive

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.559
values of the named experts called name

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.039
so all our three modules a b and c were

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:24.880
requested and fetched on the initial

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.640
page load and now let's also take a look

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.079
at the transformation what bit has

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.799
applied to glob function call so right

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:36.359
here we can see it was transformed into

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:39.240
three static Imports where every import

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:43.000
Imports only one piece of data called

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.920
name and down here all this data gets GA

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.240
it within one object and this object

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.839
gets assigned to modules constant which

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.799
at the end gets printed to the console

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.200
so as we can see this glob function

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:58.599
which VI provides us with to load

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.039
several modules at once is pretty

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.440
powerful and lets us import multiple

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.039
modules in several different ways in
